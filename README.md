In assignment 3 I used many Bootstrap features like:
1. Grid system elements(container, row, col) to differenciate sections and properly locate them on screen
2. Responsive classes (col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12) to achieve more responsive design
3. Progress bar to display my progress in different type of skills
4. Cards to sum up and show info about my education path in neat way
5. Buttons to make colorful and interactive contact links
